## Phase 1 : Problem Definition

#### Area
Tennis

#### Project Title
Analysis of tennis players’ playstyle and suggestion of countermeasures for each type

#### Data sources
- tennisabstract.com
- atptour.com

#### Issues addressed 
Professional tennis players play the game in different ways. Each has different advantages and disadvantages, and they must adjust their play to defeat the opponent's play style. The purpose of this project is by using the game data of tennis players from the past to the present, to classify players into several types based on similarities and differences and analyze their play styles and pros and cons for each type. If applied to the actual industry, the project can be used in part to propose competition strategies according to the type of matchup opponent and predict the points and the results of the game.


## Phase 2 : Data Collection

I got several data sets about 3,600 tennis matches from 1960 to 2022 and detailed stats of those form tennisabstract.com. These data sets are results of Match Charting Project (MCP). MCP match records contain shot-by-shot data for every point of a match and some overview information. Among many data about tennis matches, I have selected several resources for this term project, and those listed below are the ones. All these data are for men’s tennis matches and will be selected and utilized according to the detailed analysis model during the project.

#### matches
This data set is about match basic information. There are features like date, tournament, player and surface of court. It has 3,608 observations from 1960 to 2022 tennis matches. 

#### points
This data is about every point in each game. Information about Set score, game score, who the server was, rally count, how the rally was processed are included. The rally process is recorded as some letter symbols like “5r28f1x@” or “4b2n#”. Each letter represents a behavior in tennis like forehand, backhand or slice. This set has 619,647 observations.

#### overview
This data has observations about each set’s overview. How many serves were in specific set? How many aces, return or unforced shot were there? You can answer these questions through this data set. 

#### shot types
This data is about how many times a player hit each type of shot (forehand, backhand, slice, drop, volley etc.) throughout the game and some detail results of the shots. 

#### others (serve basics, return depth, net points, serve & volley)
There are some data sets for specific tennis plays like serve, return, net play and serve & volley. Each data set has observations for specific numerical information of each type of play. Through these data sets, I will analyze the tendency of each player’s play type and classify it into several groups. 

## Phase 3 : Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
At the beginning, there were enough data that that I can find, but those were scattered in too many files. I decided to reorganize given data sets into four main data sets like below. So I reorganized the raw data to the form that I needed, and data cleaning were done during the process.

- Dataset for matches
- Dataset for rallies, or each point
- Dataset for serves
- Dataset for shots taken by each player

```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# clean env
rm(list = ls())

# install packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(class)

# constant value
DATA_DIR <- "tennis_MatchChartingProject/men"

# data sets
matches <- read.csv(str_glue("{DATA_DIR}/charting-m-matches.csv"), quote = "")
points <- read.csv(str_glue("{DATA_DIR}/charting-m-points.csv"))
serve_basics <- read.csv(str_glue("{DATA_DIR}/charting-m-stats-ServeBasics.csv"))
s_n_v <- read.csv(str_glue("{DATA_DIR}/charting-m-stats-Snv.csv"))
shot_types <- read.csv(str_glue("{DATA_DIR}/charting-m-stats-ShotTypes.csv"))

```
  

### Data 1 - data_matches
This dataset has the basic information about the tennis matches.
It consists of columns of match_id, date, player1, player2, tournament, court, surface

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_matches <- matches %>%
  select(match_id, Date, Player.1, Player.2, Tournament, Court, Surface) %>%
  rename(date = Date, player1 = Player.1, player2 = Player.2, tournament = Tournament, court = Court, surface = Surface)
```
```{r}
# check summary and if there are NA values in the data
summary(data_matches)
names(which(colSums(is.na(data_matches)) > 0))
```

#### Preprocessing 1
The column “date” was given as number type in the raw data set. I’m planning to use the date data in my project, so I convert the number type value (yyyyMMdd) to the date value(yyyy-MM-dd) by using some character methods and as.Date function.

```{r}
### Preprocessing 1 
date_num <- data_matches$date
date_str <- str_glue("{substr(date_num, 1, 4)}-{substr(date_num, 5, 6)}-{substr(date_num, 7, 8)}")
data_matches$date <- as.Date(date_str)

head(data_matches)
```

### Data 2 - data_points
This dataset has the basic information about the tennis matches.
It consists of columns of match_id, seq, set1, set2, gm1, gm2, points, gm, svr, x1st, x2nd, winner, isSvrWinner, rallyCount

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_points <- points %>%
  select(match_id, Pt, Set1, Set2, Gm1, Gm2, Pts, Gm., Svr, X1st, X2nd, PtWinner, isSvrWinner, rallyCount) %>%
  rename(seq = Pt, set1 = Set1, set2 = Set2, gm1 = Gm1, gm2 = Gm2, points = Pts, gm = Gm., svr = Svr, x1st = X1st, x2nd = X2nd, winner = PtWinner)
```
```{r}
# check summary and if there are NA values in the data
summary(data_points)
names(which(colSums(is.na(data_points)) > 0))
```

#### Preprocessing 2
There were some observations that has NA values in column gm1 or gm2. In this dataset, those observations are not that necessary so I just removed the observations with NA.

```{r}
### Preprocessing 2
data_points <- data_points %>%
  filter(!is.na(gm1) & !is.na(gm2))

names(which(colSums(is.na(data_points)) > 0))
```

#### Preprocessing 3
At first, column "gm" was containing two information (game # and seq in game) as a string value using parenthesis. (like “2 (3)” which means it is third shot in second game) So I divided column "gm" into two number type columns "gm" and "seqInGm" using character methods.

```{r}
### Preprocessing 3
gm_split <- str_split_fixed(data_points$gm, " ", 2)

data_points <- data_points %>%
  mutate(
    seqInGm = substr(gm_split[, 2], 2, nchar(gm_split[, 2]) - 1),
    gm = gm_split[, 1]
    )
```

#### Preprocessing 4
The column "rallyCount" was character value, so I had to convert it to integer value.

```{r}
### Preprocessing 4
data_points <- data_points %>%
  mutate(rallyCount = as.integer(rallyCount)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rallyCount))
```

### Data 3 - data_serves
This dataset has informations about serves like the number of serve, aces and won points, the direction of serves and Serve & Volley.
It consists of columns of match_id, player, pts, ptsWon, aces, ptsWonLte3Shots, wide, body, t, snvPts, snvRatio, snvPtsWnRatio.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_serves <- serve_basics %>%
  select(match_id, row, pts, pts_won, aces, pts_won_lte_3_shots, wide, body, t) %>%
  rename(ptsWon = pts_won, ptsWonLte3Shots = pts_won_lte_3_shots) %>%
  filter(row == "1 Total" | row == "2 Total") %>%
  rename(player = row) %>%
  mutate(player = as.integer(str_split_fixed(player, " ", 2)[,1]))
```

#### Preprocessing 5
I wanted to bind the information about Serve & Volley to the basic data set about serve. So I reorganized the dataset about Serve & Volley and using left join function combined them into one data frame about serve. After doing left join, some NA values occured, so I handled them in a proper way. In this case, NA was meaning that SnV was not tried. Thus, replacing them with 0 was the most proper way.

```{r}
snv <- s_n_v %>%
  select(match_id, player, row, snv_pts, pts_won) %>%
  filter(row == "SnV")

non_snv <- s_n_v %>%
  select(match_id, player, row, snv_pts, pts_won) %>%
  filter(row == "nonSnV")

data_snv <- left_join(snv, non_snv, by = c("match_id", "player")) %>%
  select(match_id, player, snv_pts.x, pts_won.x, snv_pts.y, pts_won.y) %>% 
  rename(snvPts = snv_pts.x, snvPtsWon = pts_won.x, nonSnvPts = snv_pts.y, nonSnvPtsWon = pts_won.y)

data_serves <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(data_snv, by = c("match_id", "player"))
  
# check summary and if there are NA values in the data
summary(data_serves)
names(which(colSums(is.na(data_serves)) > 0))

# There are NAs in column related "SnV", which mean not tried, so replace them with 0
data_serves[is.na(data_serves)] <- 0
```

### Data 4 - data_shots
This dataset has information about how each player hit the ball. (type, count, was it winning shot and etc)
It consists of columns of match_id, player, type, shots, winners, serveRet, shotsInPtsWon, shotsInPtsLost

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_shots <- shot_types %>%
  select(match_id, player, row, shots, winners, serve_return, shots_in_pts_won, shots_in_pts_lost) %>%
  rename(type = row, serveRet = serve_return, shotsInPtsWon = shots_in_pts_won, shotsInPtsLost = shots_in_pts_lost)
```

#### Preprocessing 6
According to the planned analysis, I did’t need some rows in the dataset, because they were unnecessary observations in my study. Thus, I removed them from the original dataset.

```{r}
### Preprocessing 6
data_shots <- data_shots %>%
  filter(type != "Fside" & type != "Bside" & type != "F" & type != "B" & type != "R" &type != "S" &
         type != "U" & type != "Y" & type != "L" & type != "M" & type != "V" & type != "Z" & type != "O")

# check summary and if there are NA values in the data
summary(data_shots)
names(which(colSums(is.na(data_shots)) > 0))
```

### Result of Data Cleaning
```{r}
head(data_matches)
head(data_points)
head(data_serves)
head(data_shots)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
write.csv(data_matches, "cleaned_data/data_matches.csv")
write.csv(data_points, "cleaned_data/data_points.csv")
write.csv(data_serves, "cleaned_data/data_serves.csv")
write.csv(data_shots, "cleaned_data/data_shots.csv")
```

## Phase 4 : EDA
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
data_matches <- read.csv("cleaned_data/data_matches.csv")
data_points <- read.csv("cleaned_data/data_points.csv")
data_serves <- read.csv("cleaned_data/data_serves.csv")
data_shots <- read.csv("cleaned_data/data_shots.csv")
data_matches <- data_matches %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date))

summary(data_matches)
summary(data_points)
summary(data_serves)
summary(data_shots)
```

### EDA 1
Basically, tennis is a game that is more advantageous to score if you serve. In fact, the data and plot show that the player who serves is twice as likely to score that point. Therefore, when analyzing actual data, more meaningful analysis will be possible if the difference between advantages and disadvantages according to these serve-receive.

```{r}
ggplot(data_points) + geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(isSvrWinner)), color = "skyblue", fill = "skyblue")
sum(data_points$isSvrWinner) / nrow(data_points) * 100
```

### EDA 2
In general, players serve the ball by targeting the inside or outside course to make it difficult for their opponents to receive the serve. According to actual data, players averaged 18.22 body(middle) serves, 36.3 wide(outside) serves, and 30.45 t-zone(inside) serves in each game. When analyzing a player, the higher the ratio of wide and t compared to the body, the more sophisticated the player can be judged as a big server.

```{r}
summary(data_serves %>% select(wide, body, t))
```

### EDA 3
The data set includes the 1970s to 2022 games, and I thought there would be differences not only between players but also between trends of the period. The data showed that the ratio of serve & volley, which used to be close to 50%, decreased over time. In modern tennis, serve & volley is not as powerful a tactic as before, so the percentage of attempts has decreased to less than 5%.

```{r}
match_date <- data_matches %>%
  select(match_id, date)

serve_1970s <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(match_date, by= "match_id") %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("1980-01-01"))

serve_1980s <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(match_date, by= "match_id") %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("1980-01-01") & date < as.Date("1990-01-01"))

serve_1990s <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(match_date, by= "match_id") %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("1990-01-01") & date < as.Date("2000-01-01"))

serve_2000s <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(match_date, by= "match_id") %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("2000-01-01") & date < as.Date("2010-01-01"))

serve_2010s <- data_serves %>%
  left_join(match_date, by= "match_id") %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("2010-01-01"))

ratio1970 <- sum(serve_1970s$snvPts) / sum(serve_1970s$pts) * 100
ratio1980 <- sum(serve_1980s$snvPts) / sum(serve_1980s$pts) * 100
ratio1990 <- sum(serve_1990s$snvPts) / sum(serve_1990s$pts) * 100
ratio2000 <- sum(serve_2000s$snvPts) / sum(serve_2000s$pts) * 100
ratio2010 <- sum(serve_2010s$snvPts) / sum(serve_2010s$pts) * 100

snv_ratio <- data.frame(period = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010), snv_ratio = c(ratio1970, ratio1980, ratio1990, ratio2000, ratio2010))
ggplot(data = snv_ratio) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = period, y = snv_ratio), color = "blue")
```

### EDA 4
We looked at the types and proportions of shots that players actually play during the game, and whether there are differences in their patterns depending on the times through a plot by era.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
shots_1970s <- data_shots %>%
  left_join(match_date, by = "match_id") %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("1980-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize_at("shots",sum,na.rm=T) %>%
  filter(type != "Total" & type != "Gs") %>%
  mutate(shots = shots / sum(shots) * 100) %>%
  mutate(period = "1970s")

shots_1980s <- data_shots %>%
  left_join(match_date, by = "match_id") %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("1990-01-01") & date >= as.Date("1980-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize_at("shots",sum,na.rm=T) %>%
  filter(type != "Total" & type != "Gs") %>%
  mutate(shots = shots / sum(shots) * 100) %>%
  mutate(period = "1980s")

shots_1990s <- data_shots %>%
  left_join(match_date, by = "match_id") %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("2000-01-01") & date >= as.Date("1990-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize_at("shots",sum,na.rm=T) %>%
  filter(type != "Total" & type != "Gs") %>%
  mutate(shots = shots / sum(shots) * 100) %>%
  mutate(period = "1990s")

shots_2000s <- data_shots %>%
  left_join(match_date, by = "match_id") %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("2010-01-01") & date >= as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize_at("shots",sum,na.rm=T) %>%
  filter(type != "Total" & type != "Gs") %>%
  mutate(shots = shots / sum(shots) * 100) %>%
  mutate(period = "2000s")

shots_2010s <- data_shots %>%
  left_join(match_date, by = "match_id") %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("1980-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize_at("shots",sum,na.rm=T) %>%
  filter(type != "Total" & type != "Gs") %>%
  mutate(shots = shots / sum(shots) * 100) %>%
  mutate(period = "2010s")

shots <- rbind(shots_1970s, shots_1980s, shots_1990s, shots_2000s, shots_2010s)
```
```{r}
shot_order <- c("Base", "Net", "Gs", "Fgs", "Bgs", "Sl", "Lo", "Vo", "Ov", "Hv", "Dr",  "H", "I", "J", "K", "P", "T", "Sw")

ggplot(shots, aes(x = factor(type, level = shot_order), y = shots, fill = type)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", na.rm = TRUE) + facet_wrap(vars(period))
```

## Phase 5 : Modeling and Analysis
In this phase, various modeling such as player clustering, logistic regression analysis, and linear regression analysis are done through tennis data.

### Modeling 1 : Clustering by Playing Type
There are various ways of classifing tennis players, and the classification of player types is sometimes not clearly applied to all players. Nevertheless, it is often divided into four types, Aggressive Baseliner, Counter Puncher, Serve & Volleyer, and All-rounder, so I used these four types for clustering model.

To briefly explain each type, first, **Aggressive Baseliner** is the most common type in modern tennis. They are the bassliner that leads the game with a powerful ground stroke from the baseline. Along with the above, **Counter Puncher**, which is equally common in modern tennis, is a baseliner that seeks an opponent's mistake or a decisive winner shot in a long rally through persistent defense, rather than focusing on strong attacks. **Serve & Volleyer** is the type that approaches the net after a strong serve or receive and seeks to score through volley. This type is relatively rare type in modern tennis. **All-rounder** is a balanced type of player that performs well not only on serve, but also on both the baseline and the net. This type of player is very rare.

In this modeling, representative players of each type were first labeled and the remaining players were clustered by K-NN based on the stat similarity of the players. There are four stats used for classification.
- Ratio of Wide & T serve among all serve
- Percentage of sub and volley attempts
- Average rally count
- Winner shot ratio between base and net

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# players list
player1 <- data_matches %>% 
  select("player1") %>%
  rename(player = "player1")

player2 <- data_matches %>%
  select("player2") %>%
  rename(player = "player2")

players <- unique(rbind(player1, player2))
for(i in 1:nrow(players)) {
  players[i,] <- str_trim(players[i,])
}
players <- unique(players)

row.names(players) <- NULL
players

########### Making a new data table for clustering players ############
NAs <- sample(c(NA), nrow(players), replace = TRUE)
NULLs <- sample(c(""), nrow(players), replace = TRUE)

data_players <- players %>%
  mutate(wide_t_ratio = NAs) %>%
  mutate(snv_ratio = NAs) %>%
  mutate(avg_rally_count = NAs) %>%
  mutate(winner_base_net_ratio = NAs) %>%
  mutate(playing_type = NULLs)

for(i in 1:nrow(players)) {
  p <- players[i,]
  m1 <- data_matches %>%
    filter(player1 == p) %>%
    select(match_id)
  
  m2 <- data_matches %>%
    filter(player2 == p) %>%
    select(match_id)
  
  # wide & t
  # snv
  srv1 <- m1 %>%
    inner_join(data_serves, by = "match_id") %>%
    filter(player == 1)
  
  srv2 <- m2 %>%
    inner_join(data_serves, by = "match_id") %>%
    filter(player == 2)
  
  srv <- rbind(srv1, srv2)
  wide_t_ratio <- (sum(srv$t) + sum(srv$wide)) / (sum(srv$t) + sum(srv$wide) + sum(srv$body)) * 100
  snv_ratio <- sum(srv$snvPts) / sum(srv$pts) * 100
  
  data_players[i, 2] <- wide_t_ratio
  data_players[i, 3] <- snv_ratio
  
  # rally count
  m <- rbind(m1, m2)
  pts <- m %>%
    inner_join(data_points, by = "match_id")
  
  avg_rally_count <- mean(pts$rallyCount)
  
  data_players[i, 4] <- avg_rally_count
  
  # winner ratio
  shots1 <- m1 %>%
    inner_join(data_shots, by = "match_id") %>%
    filter(player == 1)
  
  shots2 <- m2 %>%
    inner_join(data_shots, by = "match_id") %>%
    filter(player == 2)
  
  shots <- rbind(shots1, shots2)
  
  base_shots <- shots %>%
    filter(type == "Base")
  
  net_shots <- shots %>%
    filter(type == "Net")
  
  winner_base_net_ratio <- sum(base_shots$winners) / max(1,sum(net_shots$winners))   
  
  data_players[i, 5] <- winner_base_net_ratio
}

# remove observations with NAs
data_players <- data_players %>%
  filter(!is.na(wide_t_ratio) & !is.na(snv_ratio) & !is.na(avg_rally_count) & !is.na(winner_base_net_ratio))

# filter only valid players
valid_players <- players %>%
  inner_join(data_players, by = "player") %>%
  select(player)
```

Among the 700 players, 590 players, excluding 110 players who lacked stat data, were classified as follows.

### Modeling 2, 3, 4 : Analysis of winning strategies by type - Logistic Regression Modeling

These three models are an analysis of winning strategies by type. There are conventional winning strategies for each type. Logistic regression analysis between indicators representing the strategy and winning, analyzed how meaningful the strategy is in the real data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# add winner value to data_matches
matches <- data_matches %>%
  mutate(winner = sample(NA, nrow(data_matches), replace = TRUE))

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches))) {
  match <- matches[i,2]
  
  pts <- data_points %>%
    filter(match_id == match)
  
  matches[i, 9] <- pts[nrow(pts),]$winner
}
```

#### Modeling 2 (Aggressive Baseliner)

Since this type generally has strength in strokes near the baseline, it is important to make them hit many shots near the net to defeat them. To verify this, analysis between the ratio of net shot and winning was conducted.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
AB <- data_players %>%
  filter(playing_type == "aggressive baseliner") %>%
  select(player)

getNetRatio <- function(mid, p) {
  total <- data_shots %>%
    filter(match_id == mid & player == p & type == "Total")
  
  net <- data_shots %>%
    filter(match_id == mid & player == p & type == "Net")
  
  r <- net[1,]$shots / total[1,]$shots * 100
  
  if(identical(r, numeric(0))) {
    return(NA)
  }
  
  return(r)
}

# AG = player1
matches_AB1 <- matches %>%
  filter(player1 %in% AB$player) %>%
  select(match_id, player1, player2, winner)

matches_AB1 <- matches_AB1 %>%
  mutate(
    is_AB_winner = if_else(winner == 1, 1, 0),
      )
matches_AB1$net_ratio <- NA

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches_AB1))) {
  matches_AB1[i,6] <- (getNetRatio(matches_AB1[i, ]$match_id, 1))

##### Evaluation

As a result of analysis, there was a somewhat significant relationship and P-value. It is not a very decisive independent variable, but it can be seen as a relatively significant strategy in tennis games where many factors are involved. So I can say that there is sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.

#### Modeling 3 (Counter Puncher)

Counter puncher is a type capable of persistent defense. Therefore, when playing against them, it is important to continue the rally more patiently than a hasty attack to finish the point quickly. To verify this, an analysis  between the proportion of opponent's winner shot among total shot and the victory was conducted.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
CP <- data_players %>%
  filter(playing_type == "counter puncher") %>%
  select(player)

getWinnerShotRatio <- function(mid, p) {
  total <- data_shots %>%
    filter(match_id == mid & player == p & type == "Total")
  
  r <- total[1,]$winner / total[1,]$shots * 100
  
  if(identical(r, numeric(0))) {
    return(NA)
  }
  
  return(r)
}

# CP = player1
matches_CP1 <- matches %>%
  filter(player1 %in% CP$player) %>%
  select(match_id, player1, player2, winner)

matches_CP1 <- matches_CP1 %>%
  mutate(
    is_CP_winner = if_else(winner == 1, 1, 0),
  )
matches_CP1$winner_shot_ratio <- NA

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches_CP1))) {
  matches_CP1[i,6] <- (getWinnerShotRatio(matches_CP1[i, ]$match_id, 2))
}

# CP = player2

  filter(player2 %in% CP$player) %>%

  )
matches_CP2$winner_shot_ratio <- NA

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches_CP2))) {
  matches_CP2[i,6] <- (getWinnerShotRatio(matches_CP2[i, ]$match_id, 1))
}

# total
matches_CP <- rbind(matches_CP1, matches_CP2) %>%
  filter(!is.na(winner_shot_ratio))
```

############### Modeling 3 ###################

  xlab("Opponent's winner shot ratio") +

```

##### Evaluation

As a result of the analysis, the independent variable was not significant for Counter Puncher's victory. The relationship was not clear and the p-value was not low enough. Conventional ideas have not been clearly demonstrated in the data. So there is not sufficient evidence to support the claim.

#### Modeling 4 (Serve & Volleyer)

Serve & Volleyer prefer to receive a weak shot and approach to the net. Therefore, when playing with them, it is important to succeed the first serve and not give the opponent a chance with a weak second serve. To verify this, an analysis was conducted between the opponent's first serve success rate and victory.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
SV <- data_players %>%
  filter(playing_type == "serve & volleyer") %>%
  select(player)


get1stSrvSuccessRatio <- function(mid, p) {
  pts <- data_points %>%
    filter(match_id == mid & svr == p)

  return(sum(if_else(pts$x2nd == "", 1, 0)) / nrow(pts) * 100)
}

# SV = player1
matches_SV1 <- matches %>%
  filter(player1 %in% SV$player) %>%
  select(match_id, player1, player2, winner)

matches_SV1 <- matches_SV1 %>%
  mutate(
    is_SV_winner = if_else(winner == 1, 1, 0),
  )
matches_SV1$fst_srv_suc_ratio <- NA

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches_SV1))) {
  matches_SV1[i,6] <- (get1stSrvSuccessRatio(matches_SV1[i, ]$match_id, 2))
}

# SV = player2
matches_SV2 <- matches %>%
  filter(player2 %in% SV$player) %>%
  select(match_id, player1, player2, winner)

matches_SV2 <- matches_SV2 %>%
  mutate(
    is_SV_winner = if_else(winner == 1, 1, 0),
  )
matches_SV2$fst_srv_suc_ratio <- NA

for (i in c(1:nrow(matches_SV2))) {
  matches_SV2[i,6] <- (get1stSrvSuccessRatio(matches_SV2[i, ]$match_id, 1))
}

# total
matches_SV <- rbind(matches_SV1, matches_SV2)
```
```{r, warning=FALSE}
############### Modeling 4 ###################

### Modeling 5 : Analysis of the relationship between serve area and serve point scoring - Linear Regression Modeling

Serve is very important in tennis. Rather than an ordinary body serve, especially a wide serve that goes outward and a T serve that goes in the opponent's backhand direction are more powerful. Thus, I conducted linear regression analysis to see the relationship between each serve area and the serve-point scoring.

##### Wide Serve
```{r}
############### Modeling 5 ###################
wide.model <- lm(ptsWon ~ wide, data = data_serves)
summary(wide.model)
plot(ptsWon ~ wide, data = data_serves)
title(main = "Linear Regression Model between Points & Wide-serve")
abline(wide.model)
```

##### T Serve
```{r}
t.model <- lm(ptsWon ~ t, data = data_serves)
summary(t.model)
plot(ptsWon ~ t, data = data_serves)
title(main = "Linear Regression Model between Points & T-serve")
abline(t.model)
```

##### Body Serve
```{r}
body.model <- lm(ptsWon ~ body, data = data_serves)
summary(body.model)
plot(ptsWon ~ body, data = data_serves)
title(main = "Linear Regression Model between Points & Body-serve")
abline(body.model)
```

##### Evaluation

As a result of analysis, in the case of Wide and T serve, significant results were shown with a low p-value and a high R square value. On the other hand, in the case of the body serve, there was no significant result, confirming that the hypothesis was correct. The more wide or T serve was succeeded than body serve, the higher the frequency of serve-point scored. There is sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.

## Phase 6: Data Product

In this phase, I made a simple R Shiny Application to show the result of my analysis. The dashboard consist of two part. One is "Player Clustering" and another is "Match Analysis of Each Player".

### Part 1
In first part, it shows a plot representing the result of K-NN Clustering Model. All Players were categorized into 4 types based on 4 criteria. So you can choose one criteria and see what the characteristics are based on the playing type. You can also filter some types by checking the options.

### Part 2
In second part, it shows a plot about Logistic Regression Analysis. In my project, when looking at all the players' data comprehensively, some conventional winning strategies did not fit well with the data. However, I thought those strategies still can fit for some players. You can choose one player and check if he fits for the conventional winning strategy. Unlike the results of the overall data confirmed in the analysis phase, the most representative players of each type showed some significant correlation.

## Conclusion

In this project, there were two hypothesis that I wanted to figure out.

#### 1) When we classify the types of tennis players through data, the baseliner will be the most, the serve & volleyer will be the relatively few, and the all-round player will be the least as it is generally known.

#### 2) The traditional winning strategies for each type (aggressive baseliner, counter pucher, serve & volleyer) will also be valid based on real match data. 

#### Analysis
Through K-NN clustering, I found sufficient evidence to support the first hypothesis.The baseliner including aggressive baseliner and counter puncher was the most and the serve & volleyer and all-round player were few.

According to the logistic regression analysis, I found sufficient evidence to support that the strategy for the aggressive baseliner is valid. On the other hand, there was not sufficient evidence to support the other two strategies. However, when it comes to the most representative players for each type, the strategies were more suitable. So I can say there was more clear evidence to support the hypothesis about the representative players for each type.
